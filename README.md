# COVID-19 Exploration
In this project I used SQL to explore some data surrounding COVID-19 cases, vaccinations and deaths. In this project there is a file showing my full SQL Code, I used Google's Big Query software for this Project, and a Markdown file that gives more details on the results of the codes.
